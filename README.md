Project Overview 
One project i really would like to work on is a Shortest Path Problem Solver using Dijkstra's Algorithm. This project aims to implement Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph. The application will provide a visual interface for users to input graphs and visualize the shortest path calculations. 

Key Features 

Graph Input: 
Allow users to input graph data through an intuitive interface or upload graph files. 
Support for both directed and undirected graphs. 

Shortest Path Calculation: 
Implement Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest path from a given source node to all other nodes in the graph. 
Display the shortest path and its cost for each node. 

Visualization: 
Provide a graphical representation of the graph. 
visually highlight the shortest path from the source node to the target nodes. 
Step-by-step visualization of the algorithmâ€™s execution. 

User Interface: 
A simple and user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with the graph and view results. 
Options to start, pause, and reset the algorithm's execution for educational purposes. 

Technologies to Use 

Programming Language: 
C++: For implementing Dijkstra's algorithm and core logic due to its performance and control over system resources. 

Graphical User Interface (GUI): 
Qt: A powerful C++ framework for developing cross-platform GUI applications. 

Graph Visualization: 
Graphviz: For rendering graphs and visualizing the shortest path results. 
Qt Graphics View Framework: To create custom graph visualizations within the Qt application. 

Development Environment: 

Visual Studio: Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) for C++ development. 
CMake: For managing the build process and dependencies.
